# LueurTech-Software-Solutions-SignUp-Page
This is the task fullfiled by Rishabh Gupta. I created a Signup page for taking input from the user such as Username, Password, etc. and a Submit button. This webpage contains the following validations :
* If user did not fill any field or put wrong length of password and clicked on the submit button, appropriate message should be displayed
I have designed an interactive page having good CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
I have also provided the image used in sign up page.
